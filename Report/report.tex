\section{Development Log}
  \subsection{Homepage \& styling}
    I have created the project, chosen the theme, developed the navigation bar, created all page files, created the logo and styled the template page. More or less everything that was attempted, besides some nitpicks with the styling, is working well. Things that could be improved include the favicon, changing text in the navigation bar and positioning of the footer. I am currently using workarounds for these. \cite{CarlosCSS}
  \subsection{Displaying items}
  \subsection{Adding, deleting \& editing items}
    Due to continued personal issues and other assignments requiring my attention, Iâ€™ve been unable to continue with the web application. These issues will be clearing up soon with the four assignments of January ending on the 23rd, at whch point I will be able to place all my focus into the programming-heavy projects at the tail end of the year.
